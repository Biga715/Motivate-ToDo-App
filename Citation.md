Used in following documents/pages:

-MongoCommands.js, index.js

    The two cited videos were used as a guide in understanding the basic structure of what to include in the MonogoCommands.js 
    and index.js pages for our project. This helped us to know how to properly complete the needed construction of the API that 
    connects Vue to MongoDB.
